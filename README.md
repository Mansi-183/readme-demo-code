## ðŸ“Š Data Analyst Sample Code

This code demonstrates a simple data analysis using Python and pandas with in-line sample data.

```python
import pandas as pd
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Sample data created within code
data = {
    'Region': ['East', 'West', 'North', 'South'],
    'Sales': [100, 150, 200, 120]
}

df = pd.DataFrame(data)

# Plotting sales by region
df.groupby('Region')['Sales'].sum().plot(kind='bar')
plt.title('Sales by Region')
plt.xlabel('Region')
plt.ylabel('Total Sales')
plt.show()
